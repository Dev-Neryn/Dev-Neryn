ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm JoÃ£o Victor, also known as Dev_Neryn, and I'm on a journey to become a skilled data analyst.

ğŸ“Š Currently, I'm exploring the fascinating world of data analysis, learning various tools and techniques to derive insights from data.

ğŸ’» I primarily work with Python, SQL, and data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. While I'm still in the learning phase, I'm eager to apply my skills to real-world data challenges and continue growing in the field.

ğŸŒŸ Let's connect and learn together! Feel free to reach out to me here on GitHub or connect with me on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joÃ£o-v-6554b820a/)
